# Sonos-Spotify-Status-Script
When playing music through Sonos connect. It is an issue related to the spotify websocket. Script restarts spotify silenty to update status. I know this is stupid : )

"Spotify-Caller" calls the restart spotify script every 30 second. Restart spotify script silently restart the spotify desktop app. I know, genius.
